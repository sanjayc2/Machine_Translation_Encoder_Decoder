# Introduction
In this notebook, as part of a Udacity project, I built an encoder-decoder neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. The completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation. The code was run on my personal gaming laptop (on a GPU)

## Install
- Python 3
- NumPy
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras 2.x

# Future Improvements

Adding (multi-head) attention to the decoder should improve the training and test results.
